        "Details": "The steel corridors of the Argo hummed softly, a steady vibration from the ship's ancient engines. I stood in my dimly lit office, poring over maps and logistics reports, the glow of the monitors casting long shadows. The intercom crackled to life, snapping me out of my focus.\r\n\r\n\"Commander, we have a situation,\" Darius' voice was tense, urgent. \"Meet me in the conference room. Now.\"\r\n\r\nI pushed away from the console and hurried through the narrow passages. The doors slid open with a hiss, and I found Darius pacing, his expression grim. He straightened as I entered, his eyes locking onto mine.\r\n\r\n\"Darius, what's going on?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's bad, Commander,\" he said, taking a deep breath. \"The military police have detained several of crew members who are [[DM.Factions[faction_Liao],Cappellan]] nationals and arrested [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] when he tried to claim mercenary company rights.\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" I felt a surge of anger and disbelief. \"On what grounds!?\"\r\n\r\n\"Their commander, certain Colonel Brannigan is claiming that, due to the Andurien-Canopian alliance's invasion of the Capellan Confederation, they have the right to impress Capellan citizens into their armed forces,\" Darius explained, his voice edged with frustration. \"They're using the conflict as an excuse to bolster their ranks with anyone they deem fit.\"\r\n\r\nI clenched my fists, trying to rein in my temper. \"This is outrageous. [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] and our crew have nothing to do with that conflict. They are infringing on our rights as independent mercenary company. We can't let this stand.\"\r\n\r\nDarius nodded. \"I know, Commander. But the colonel is adamant. He says it's a matter of planetary security and legal jurisdiction. We don't have much leverage here.\"",

Darius and I stood alone, contemplating our options.\r\n\r\n\"We can't just leave them, Commander,\" Darius said, his voice calm but firm. \"But we need to be smart about this.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded, thinking quickly. \"We have another option, Darius. Lady Marina Liao.\"\r\n\r\nDarius raised an eyebrow. \"Our Mercenary Liaison Officer for the Capellan Confederation? Do you think she\u2019ll help?\"\r\n\r\nI met his gaze. \"We've built a good relationship with her. If anyone can cut through this bureaucratic nonsense, it's Marina.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded slowly. \"It's worth a shot.\"\r\n\r\nLater that day we had Marina on our com link. She looked composed, but there was a hint of curiosity in her eyes that even low resolution holographic image could not hide.\r\n\r\n\"Commander, it's been a while. What\u2019s the urgency?\" Marina asked.\r\n\r\nI quickly explained the situation, detailing the arrest of our crew by the military police. \"Marina, we need your help to get them released. They're being forced into the armed forces under the guise of the threat of Andurien-Canopian invasion.\"\r\n\r\nShe frowned, considering my words. \"This is a delicate situation, Commander. But given our history and the service your unit has provided to the Confederation, I\u2019ll see what I can do.\"\r\n\r\nDarius and I waited anxiously as Marina made her calls. After what felt like an eternity, her image reappeared on the screen.\r\n\r\n\"Good news,\" she said, a slight smile playing on her lips. \"I've spoken with the governor. Your crew will be released immediately. Consider this a favor between friends.\"\r\n\r\nI let out a breath I hadn't realized I was holding. \"Thank you, Marina. You don't know what this means to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just remember this when we next need your services,\" she said with a nod before signing off.",
