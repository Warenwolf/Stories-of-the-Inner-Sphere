        "Details" : "I crouched behind a weather-beaten supply shack in a small periphery settlement on on {TGT_SYSTEM.Name}, flanked by [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] and [[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]]. We were on a routine resupply mission when the sudden, thunderous roar of raider shuttles filled the sky and the coms went down.\r\n\r\n\"Looks like our resupply just got complicated,\" I muttered, peeking around the corner. I could see the raiders disembarking from their shuttles at the edge of the settlement, forming a loose perimeter. The distinct crack of small arms fire echoed through the settlement as panicked civilians ran for cover.\r\n\r\n[[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] checked {TGT_MW.Det} sidearm, a worn but reliable slug thrower. \"Commander, we're outgunned and outnumbered. We need to make a call.\"\r\n\r\n[[SCN_MW,{SCN_MW.Callsign}]] nodded, {SCN_MW.Det} eyes scanning the area. \"We can either try wait out the raiders, holing up in a secure defensive position or make a break for the Leopard and get back to the Argo - provided they haven't been discovered by raiders first. What's the play?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nI considered our options. We were professional mechswarriors but infantry tactics were another matter and there was only three of us.\r\n\r\nOn other hand raiders were probably not trained infantrymen either and certainly not used to a stand up fight - and the Leopard may not be there if Sumire has been forced to lift off due to fighting.",
