The wait for news from Saul was agonizing.\r\n\r\nThe door creaked open and a familiar figure slipped inside. It was [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]], {TGT_MW.Det} eyes scanning the room before settling on us. {TGT_MW.Subj_C} approached, a grin spreading across {TGT_MW.Det} face.\r\n\r\n\"Commander, Darius,\" [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]] said, sliding into the booth. \"Your friend Saul got me out. Military police released me without even processing me.\"\r\n\r\nRelief washed over me, but [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]]\u2019s expression turned serious. \"But there might be a catch. I overheard one of Saul's men driving me here mentioning that Saul got trouble with the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreMaskirovka],Maskirovka]]. The two of them were really scared.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDarius cursed under his breath. \"That complicates things. If the Maskirovka is involved, Saul might be compromised.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded, weighing our options. \"Saul came through for us with [[TGT_MW,{TGT_MW.Callsign}]], but we can't ignore the risk. If he's under Maskirovka\u2019s thumb, he might turn on us to save his own skin.\"\r\n\r\nDarius leaned forward. \"So, do we cut ties with Saul or use him while keeping a close watch?\"",

When the convoy arrived, seeing our detained crew members safe and sound was a moment of profound relief.\r\n\r\nAs the Argo\u2019s ramp closed behind us, I turned to Darius. \"We took a risk, and it paid off this time.\"\r\n\r\nDarius nodded, a rare smile on his face. \"Let's hope our luck holds.\"\r\n\r\nFor now, we had our people back, and that was all that mattered.",

Our crew?\"\r\n\r\nI accessed our financial records, confirming the transaction to Saul,  \"The money is gone and our people...they're not coming back.\"\r\n\r\nI knew I had one more difficult task ahead.
