But Sumire and Farah identified a re-education camp where our crew's likely held.\"\r\n\r\nI stopped, staring at the map. \"A direct assault?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possible,\" Darius replied. \"But risky. It'll strain our relations with the Capellans severely and our people may not even be there.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can't abandon them,\" I said, frustration edging my voice.\r\n\r\n\"Agreed,\" Darius said. \"But we need to weigh our options. Bribery might ensure their release without bloodshed, but it carries risks. A rescue mission, however, will damage our relationsips with Capellan Confederation and risk lives.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded slowly. \"Both paths carry heavy risks. But we must decide.\"",

Do you think she\u2019ll help?\"\r\n\r\nI met his gaze. \"We've built a good relationship with her. If anyone can cut through this bureaucratic nonsense, it's Marina.\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded slowly. \"It's worth a shot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLater that day we had Marina on our com link. She looked composed, but there was a hint of curiosity in her eyes that even low resolution holographic image could not hide.\r\n\r\n\"Commander, it's been a while. What\u2019s the urgency?\" Marina asked.\r\n\r\nI quickly explained the situation, detailing the arrest of our crew by the military police.\r\n\r\n\"Marina, we need your help to get them released. They're being forced into the armed forces under the guise of the threat of Andurien-Canopian invasion.\"\r\n\r\nShe frowned, considering my words.\r\n\r\n\"This is a delicate situation, Commander. But given our history and the service your unit has provided to the Confederation, I\u2019ll see what I can do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDarius and I waited anxiously as Marina made her calls. After what felt like an eternity, her image reappeared on the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Good news,\" she said, a slight smile playing on her lips. \"I've spoken with the governor. Your crew will be released immediately. Consider this a favor between friends.\"\r\n\r\nI let out a breath I hadn't realized I was holding. \"Thank you, Marina. You don't know what this means to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just remember this when we next need your services,\" she said with a nod before signing off.",
