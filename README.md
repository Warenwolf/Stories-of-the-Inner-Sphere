![StoreisOfTheInnerSphere](https://github.com/Warenwolf/Stories-of-the-Inner-Sphere/assets/136007621/702ce980-52a1-4048-b2d8-891833f2aaa7)

Welcome to the "Stories of the Inner Sphere" mod which aims to add more events to is to enrich the existing
content in the game Battletech (developed by Harebrained Schemes) by introducing additional "events" and
CYOA type of stories to the game. The diference between this mod and "News Events Expanded"is that the later
focuses on in-game news services lore snippets while this mod is more concerned in telling stories related to the crew of Argo.

While the focus has been adding event to "BattleTech Extended 3025-3061" adapting these events to other modpacks 
(like BTA3062 or RT) or vanila game should be fairly easy. 

Currently this mod is in a very early stage and has very little content (2 CYOA stories) but I aim to expand it in the future and if lucky convince someone to join me in this project.
